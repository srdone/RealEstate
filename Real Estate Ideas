Real Estate - Rough Requirements

A fencing-in game of posts and fences. The winner is the one who fences in the most squares.

The game board consists of squares arranged in a rectangular fashion. At the beginning, the squares just consist of four posts. Adjacent squares share their posts. There are no areas within the rectangle where there are missing squares.

Each player takes a turn choosing where a fence should appear. When one box is completely fenced in (ie - each of the four sides has a fence going from one corner post to the other), the last person to have fenced it in wins that square and then gets another opportunity to choose a fence location. The game board updates to indicate which player won the square.

Once all posts have the maxiumum number of fences possible coming from them (four in most cases, 3 if it is a post on the edge of the board, 2 if it is a corner post), the game is over and the player with the maximum number of fenced in squares wins.

Some notes about how to know if the game is functioning correctly:

1 - At the end, the fences will create a regular grid across the gameboard, with verices at the gameposts
2 - At the end, there won't be any 1x1 squares that have not been fenced in.
3 - There can be situations where one player gets many squares in a row if they are able to get the fences just right.
4 - The game board should be planned so the number of squares is not divisible without remainder by the number of players. Otherwise a tie can result.
5 - The players can put a fence anywhere horizontally or vertically between two posts. Watch for these problems:
	-A fence cannot be placed on an edge pointing away from the rest of the game board
	-A fence cannot be placed diagonally
	-A fence cannot be removed once it is placed
	-Only once fence per side (per node on the post) is allowed
